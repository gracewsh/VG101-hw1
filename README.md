## Problem 4b
1. What is a binary search?
> Binary search is a search algorithm that deals with sorted arrays. It takes the middle number of the array and compares it with the target value, if they are not equal, it goes on to take the half that ideal value lies in and again pick the middle number to comapre. In this way the target value can be found when the middle number equals to the target.
